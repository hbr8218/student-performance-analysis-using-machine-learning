## Overview
This is Analysis on student's performance and how the performance gets affected by differect factors. Analysis has been done in three dataset sets:- 
- My own college sample dataset.
- Two datasets from [UCI Machine learning repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). </br>
This data approach student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools. The data attributes include student grades, demographic, social and school related features) and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires. Two datasets are provided regarding the performance in two distinct subjects: Mathematics (mat) and Portuguese language (por). In [Cortez and Silva, 2008], the two datasets were modeled under binary/five-level classification and regression tasks. Important note: the target attribute G3 has a strong correlation with attributes G2 and G1. This occurs because G3 is the final year grade (issued at the 3rd period), while G1 and G2 correspond to the 1st and 2nd period grades. It is more difficult to predict G3 without G2 and G1, but such prediction is much more useful (see paper source for more details).


## Motivation
Thinking about the final year project (B.TECH), A question came on my mind that why my college does not come in the categories of avarage colleges, why my college is not counted with India's top colleges > How the performance of students affect the college and what factors might be there which influenced the performance of the students. Thus, I decided to do a analysis on student's performance on sample dataset. Before that I had to do the same thing with a public dataset which I found in [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php) and got two datasets dealing with different factors affecting student's performace in two subjects i.e. Math and Portuguese Language.
